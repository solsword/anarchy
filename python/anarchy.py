  Implements an incremental shuffle, such that if you were to call
  `cohort_shuffle` on each index in a cohort of a given size, each of
  the items would end up in a different new spot within that cohort.
  The shuffle is reversible using the `rev_cohort_shuffle` function.

  It works by composing several of the simpler reversible/indexable
  functions to produce a sufficiently complex operation that humans
  generally won't be able to see the pattern it uses.
  
  Note that this should *not* be used for cryptography or statistics:
  when the cohort size is even moderately large (say 100), the number
  of possible shuffles (constrained by the seed, which is 64 bits, so
  2^64) will be much smaller than the number of possible orderings of
  the items, so not all possible orderings will be able to be produced.

  Both the seed and the cohort size are used to determine the
  particular ordering of items, so the same seed with a different
  cohort size won't necessarily produce a similar ordering to another

  we're in segment `segment` of those, computes how many items are in
  this segment. The `roughness` argument must be a number between 0 and
  1 indicating how even the distribution is: 0 indicates a perfectly
  even distribution, while 1 indicates a perfectly random distribution.
  Does work proportional to the log of the number of segments.
  
  Note that segment_capacity * n_segments should be > total.

    - `roughness` (float in [0,1]): How rough the distribution should

  returns the number of items in all segments before the given segment.
